# otpDreams
My dreams encrypted with a simple OTP.

If you contact me directly, and we get to know each other, I might give you the decryption steps.

But all the ingredients to decrypt these are on the Internet, and I made it easy!

(I could have just excluded the Python script and made it much harder.)

I took that step because dreams are full of personal names and things like that. Once upon a time a Swedish guy I met googled himself, found himself in an unflattering way in one of my dreams, and emailed me that he was upset.

So, in other words, I would encourage everyone to use this to encrypt their own dreams.

Usage:

Decoding:
`cat PADFILE | ./otp.py ENCODEDFILE > DECODEDFILE`

Encoding:
`cat PADFILE | ./otp.py PLAINTEXT > ENCODEDFILE`
